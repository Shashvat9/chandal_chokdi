## *🌍 Introduction*
This project focuses on implementing a lunar rover path detection system that leverages deep learning models for semantic segmentation and object detection. The system is designed to work with lunar-specific datasets to ensure accurate and reliable navigation on the lunar surface.

## *⚙️ Prerequisites*

### *Hardware Requirements:*
- A machine with *GPU support* for training deep learning models.
- *Optional:* Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson for deployment on rover hardware.

### *Software Requirements:*
- *Python 3.8+*
- *TensorFlow* or *PyTorch*
- *Streamlit* for creating the user interface
- *Anaconda* for managing Python environments

## *📦 Installation*

### *1. Clone the Repository:*
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lunar-rover-path-detection.git
cd lunar-rover-path-detection


### *2. Create a Virtual Environment:*
bash
conda create -n lunar_rover python=3.8
conda activate lunar_rover


### *3. Install Dependencies:*
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### *4. Install Streamlit:*
bash
pip install streamlit


## *🗂️ Data Preparation*

### *1. Gather Lunar Datasets:*
- High-resolution *Lunar Terrain Maps*
- *Lunar Rock Distribution Maps*
- *Illumination Maps*
- Previous *Rover Traverses*

### *2. Preprocess Data:*
- *Normalize* the datasets to ensure consistent scale.
- *Annotate* the data with labels (e.g., safe terrain, obstacles, craters).
- *Augment* the data to increase robustness (e.g., rotations, lighting variations).

### *3. Data Split:*
- Split the data into *training, **validation, and **test* sets.

## *🧠 Model Training*

### *1. Select Pre-Trained Models:*
- Use models like *UNet, **SegNet, or **DeepLabV3* for semantic segmentation.
- Use *YOLO, **Faster R-CNN, or **SSD* for object detection.

### *2. Fine-Tune Models:*
- Perform *transfer learning* using lunar-specific datasets.
- Adjust the final layers to suit lunar conditions.
- Train the models and evaluate their performance using *IoU* and *mAP*.

### *3. Save the Trained Models:*
- Save the models in the models/ directory.

## *🗺️ Path Planning*

### *1. Semantic Segmentation:*
- Use the trained segmentation model to generate a *traversability map*.

### *2. Object Detection:*
- Deploy the object detection model to identify *hazards*.

### *3. Implement Path Planning Algorithm:*
- Use *A* or **Dijkstra’s algorithm* to find the optimal path.
- Consider the traversability map and detected hazards.

## *🛠️ Simulation and Testing*

### *1. Simulate the Environment:*
- Use custom-built simulators to test the models and path planning algorithms.
- Simulate different terrain types and lighting conditions.

### *2. Test on Hardware:*
- Deploy the models on the rover’s hardware.
- Test the system in controlled environments.

## *🖥️ User Interface with Streamlit*

### *1. Build the User Interface:*
- Create a *Streamlit* app to visualize the rover’s path, detected hazards, and other critical metrics.
- Use Streamlit components like st.map, st.image, and st.metric to display real-time data.

### *2. Display Real-Time Data:*
- Integrate the model outputs with the Streamlit app to display real-time path predictions and hazard detections.
- Allow users to interact with the interface to select different paths and visualize their outcomes.

### *3. Launch the Streamlit App:*
bash
streamlit run app.py


## *🚧 Challenges and Considerations*
- *Computational Limitations:* Optimize models to fit the rover's processing power.
- *Real-Time Decision Making:* Ensure the system can make navigation decisions quickly.
- *Adapting to Lunar Conditions:* Account for unique lunar conditions like lower gravity and varying illumination.

## *🌟 Future Work*
- *Dynamic Lighting Conditions:* Incorporate real-time lighting data into the model.
- *Continuous Learning:* Implement incremental learning techniques to update the models during the mission.
